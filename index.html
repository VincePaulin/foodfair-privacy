  <h1>FoodFair – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="meta"><strong>Last updated:</strong> 19 November 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how FoodFair (“we”, “our”, or “us”) handles information when you use
    the FoodFair mobile application (“the App”).
  </p>
  <p>
    FoodFair is a utility app that helps you split restaurant bills and shared expenses between people.
    We aim to collect and process as little personal data as possible.
  </p>

  <hr class="section-separator">

  <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1. Information you enter in the app</h3>
  <p>The App allows you to enter information related to a bill, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Item names (e.g. dishes, drinks, menus)</li>
    <li>Item prices, taxes, tips, and discounts</li>
    <li>Names or labels of participants (e.g. “Alice”, “Bob”, “Roommate 1”)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This information is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong> and is used only to calculate how much
    each person should pay.
  </p>
  <p>We do not:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transfer this bill data to our own servers</li>
    <li>Use it to identify you personally</li>
    <li>Sell or share it with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2. Device and usage data from third-party services (AdMob)</h3>
  <p>
    FoodFair displays advertisements using <strong>Google AdMob</strong> and the Google Mobile Ads SDK.
    These third-party services may automatically collect certain information, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device identifiers (e.g. advertising ID)</li>
    <li>IP address and approximate location (country/region)</li>
    <li>App usage information related to ad display (e.g. impressions, clicks)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This data is collected and processed by Google in accordance with their own privacy policies and terms.
    We do not have access to all of these raw data points, but we may access aggregated reports
    (for example, to see how many ad impressions or clicks occurred).
  </p>
  <p>For more information on how Google processes data for advertising, please see:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Google Privacy Policy:
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://policies.google.com/privacy
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Google’s information on advertising and cookies:
      <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
        https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr class="section-separator">

  <h2>2. How we use information</h2>

  <p>We use the information described above for the following purposes:</p>

  <h3>2.1. Bill calculation and display</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To calculate how much each person should pay</li>
    <li>To show you a summary of items, totals, taxes, tips, and per-person amounts</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2. Local history and convenience</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To keep recent bills or notes on your device so you can review or reuse them</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3. Advertising and app monetization (via AdMob)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>To display ads that help us support the development and maintenance of the App</li>
    <li>To prevent fraud and ensure ad performance and security</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    We do not build personal profiles based on your bill data.
    Any profiling for advertising purposes (such as personalized ads) is handled by Google AdMob
    according to your device settings and Google’s own policies.
  </p>

  <hr class="section-separator">

  <h2>3. Data storage and retention</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Bill data and local settings</strong> (currency, preferences, etc.) are stored on your device only.
    This data remains until you:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete it manually in the app (if the app provides such an option), or</li>
    <li>Uninstall the app or clear its data in your device settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Advertising-related data collected by Google (AdMob) is stored and retained by Google in accordance
    with their own retention policies. We do not control how long Google keeps this data.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not maintain our own separate online database of your bills or personal data.
  </p>

  <hr class="section-separator">

  <h2>4. Children’s privacy</h2>

  <p>
    FoodFair is intended for general use by adults and older teens who manage shared expenses.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App is <strong>not specifically directed to children under 13 years of age</strong>, and we do not knowingly
    collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that the App has collected personal
    information from a child under 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete such
    information where reasonably possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Parents or guardians who have questions about the App or believe that their child has provided personal data
    can contact us using the information in the <strong>Contact</strong> section below.
  </p>

  <hr class="section-separator">

  <h2>5. Your choices and controls</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      You can delete local bill data at any time by removing entries in the App or uninstalling the App.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can manage your <strong>advertising preferences</strong> and reset your device’s advertising ID in your
      device settings (for example, under “Ads” or “Privacy” settings on Android).
    </li>
    <li>
      If your region requires consent for personalized ads (e.g. GDPR in the EU/EEA), the App may display a consent
      dialog or rely on the consent management handled by Google.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <hr class="section-separator">

  <h2>6. Data sharing</h2>

  <p>We do not sell your personal data.</p>
  <p>We may share limited information in the following ways:</p>

  <h3>6.1. With service providers for advertising</h3>
  <p>
    We use Google AdMob and related Google services to display ads. These providers may receive device and usage
    data as described in Section 1.2.
  </p>

  <h3>6.2. For legal reasons</h3>
  <p>
    If required to do so by law or in response to valid legal requests (e.g., court order, government request),
    we may disclose information that is necessary to comply with such obligations.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other than the above, we do not share your bill data or personally identifying information with third parties.
  </p>

  <hr class="section-separator">

  <h2>7. International data transfers</h2>

  <p>
    Because advertising and analytics services such as Google AdMob may operate servers around the world,
    information processed by these third-party services may be transferred to and stored in other countries
    with different data-protection laws.
  </p>
  <p>
    Google implements measures to comply with applicable data-protection laws when transferring data internationally.
    For more details, please see Google’s privacy documentation.
  </p>

  <hr class="section-separator">

  <h2>8. Security</h2>

  <p>
    We take reasonable measures to protect the App and the information processed through it. However, no method of
    transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of information,
    especially for data handled by third-party services such as AdMob.
  </p>
  <p>
    Local data (your bills, items, and participants) are stored on your device in accordance with the normal
    security and privacy protections of your operating system.
  </p>

  <hr class="section-separator">

  <h2>9. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the App, our practices,
    or legal requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we make significant changes, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
    Continued use of the App after such changes means you accept the revised Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <hr class="section-separator">
